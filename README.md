# About

This project is a single-page email application built using Django for the
backend and JavaScript for the frontend. It allows users to register, log in,
send and receive emails, and manage their inbox, sent mail, and archived
messages through a dynamic interface without reloading the page.

This website was created as part of
[CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-web-programming-python-and-javascript),
an online course focused on designing and implementing web applications using
Python, JavaScript, and SQL with frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap.
